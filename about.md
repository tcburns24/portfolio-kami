<strong>WHO I AM</strong> <br>
Hello and thank you for visiting my page! I’m Tom, I live in Silicon Valley and I’m enrolled in Bloc’s software engineering track. Software development is new to me; after six years in education I decided it was time for a career switch, so I enrolled in Bloc. The best and worst thing about Bloc is that everyday’s a challenge; nothing comes easy, nothing comes quickly. Even though I sometimes pull my hair out (figuratively, that is) in fits of frustration, I also can feel my development skills sharpening through the apprenticeship. As much as I’m enjoying studying software, I’m even more eager to graduate and begin a career as an engineer.

<strong>WHAT I'VE DONE</strong> <br>
After studying Mandarin Chinese in college, my professional career began as a special education teacher in Teach For America. Over the next 5 years I spent time in both public and private schools, working my way to become the principal of a private school, and eventually landing at a robotics startup company. It was during my time at the robotics startup that my interest in coding blossomed into a full blown obsession. Tinkering on codecademy wasn’t enough to satiate my appetite for the world of development; it was time to enroll in Bloc!

<strong>HOW I CAN BENEFIT A COMPANY</strong> <br>
Over the course of my background I’ve developed skills that I’m eager to contribute to a company. Here’s what makes me unique: <br>
<br>
<strong>I'm Bilingual</strong>: I can’t imagine life without Chinese. After 13 years studying the language, Chinese and I are joined at the hip. Am I fluent in the language? To be honest, I wouldn’t even say I’m fluent in English; but after two degrees and a Fulbright, I can say my Mandarin is fairly 不错! <br>
<br>
<strong>I Love Public Speaking</strong>: A side effect of studying Chinese is its extermination of public speaking anxiety. As a kid,I was as nervous to get in front of a group of people as most, until 2013 when I spent the summer in Beijing speaking Mandarin at professional conferences in front of native Chinese speakers. Let me tell you, any lingering public speaking anxiety died that summer! Since then, I find myself quick to volunteer for presentations, videos, conferences, etc.. The robotics company I worked for offered plenty of opportunities to utilize this skill, and I’m hopeful I’ll have a chance to continue using it when I begin my career as a developer. <br>
<br>
<strong>I've Had a Wide Range of Experience</strong>: While working in education, I spent time as a green first-year teacher, a seasoned principal, and everywhere in between. This wide range of managerial levels taught me quite a bit about communication, collaborating with colleagues, and taking responsibility for results. Thanks to this range of experience I have the confidence to enter my new career and produce at any level. <br>
<br>
<strong>I'm Passionate About Coding</strong>: Most importantly, I’ll bring a passion for software development to my new career. It hasn’t taken long for me to fall in love with the software world and I wake up each day yearning to improve my skill set. If a company seeks an experienced developer with oodles of experience, I can’t be of service. But if a company is looking for an energetic developer with a fervor for the field, and zeal for improving his skill set—I’m your guy!
