## Explanation

Bloccit takes its inspiration from Reddit, and demonstrates Rails' ability to connect multiple models.

## Problem

The only "problem" in this project was that it was my very first. As a newcomer to programming, anything and everything about the project was entirely new; the vocabulary, the rails structure, even the terminal itself was still a novelty. Although the structure of the app is fairly straightforward, learning my way around the world of a Rails app proved difficult.

## Solution

Collaboration to the rescue. Bloc designs this project to be done with ample support from both my mentor, and the bloc curriculum. With consistent check-ins to both resource, I managed to complete the project and learn a ton about Rails in the process. Sometimes Rails is its own teacher!


## Conclusion

Bloccit's revealed the importance of having a personal "library" for future projects. As a programmer, memorizing all the syntax of even one simple app is not a reasonable expectation. Therefore, having a project for reference is invaluable. Bloccit, since it was my first full project, has become this reference library for me. Knowing how to look for and retrieve information is a more practical skill than memorizing tomes of code.
